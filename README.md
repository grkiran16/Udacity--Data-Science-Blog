## Background
Airbnb, Inc. is an online marketplace for arranging or offering lodging, primarily home stays, or tourism experiences. The company does not own any of the real estate listings, nor does it host events; it acts as a broker, receiving commissions from each booking. The company is based in San Francisco, California, United States.
The company was conceived after its founders put an air mattress in their living room, effectively turning their apartment into a bed and breakfast, in order to offset the high cost of rent in San Francisco; Airbnb is a shortened version of its original name, AirBedandBreakfast.com.
The data used for this analysis was sourced from Kaggle open data sets through Udacity Data Scientist nano degree program. The data includes the rental information data if Airbnb in Seattle, it contains information like listing price, amenities, reviews, availability, rental property details etc.
While working on this project we tried to understand different patterns and trends of how the distribution of Airbnb property prices are in Seattle and how are the distributed by the various neighborhoods. What are the main factors which are driving the price of the properties depending on the property characters, neighborhood and various other factors.
